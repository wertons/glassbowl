[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ee23c0c5-bf7d-4495-aba0-62aca86d629e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/glassbowl/deploys)

### What is this project

Sometimes in a new company you have to open a few web pages, for example, a web for time management, another web for communication and a web for the management of tasks. This application tries to automatize that task of opening multiple pages. The idea is that a user can store a school of fishes (group of urls). If the user clicks the school assigned to their company they will open all the pages at the same time. This is useful for working on multiple companies/projects or for personal use and entertainment.  

### How can we manage this task

You will log in in our application and you will set a task like 'Pages for working' and all their pages. Once set up the urls in your task you could open every url assigned in a click. This information and configuration will be stored in our application and will speed up the process of setting up the web pages for working.
